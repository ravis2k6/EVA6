The excel spreadsheet has two tabs. In tab1 we have computed the derivatives and errors using different LR

For each LR value the error is then copied to a tablle in tab 2. For all LR =[0.1,0.2,0.5,0.8,1,2] the values are stored and used to create a graph

The below graph plots Total Error vs Learning Rate
